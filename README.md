# The-Meals-App

   Building  meals app. An app where can view some recipes and also filter recipes. I'll need some navigation.
I'll have our header  with some title in the middle and with a menu button on the left which allows us to open a side drawer  and at the bottom of this page , will  have two tabs - one for all meals, all recipes and one for our favorites which will of course be able to add in this app.On that all page, have a grid of categories, so basically something like Italian, exotic, maybe Turkish food, so basically different food categories and when we tap one of these categories, I'll be taken on a second screen where  then have a back button at the top to go back with another title, the category title and on that screen,  then have the recipes.
   
   So there, I'll have multiple such cards with an image, a title, some extra information about the recipe like how long it takes to create it and so on, so when  click the back button,  of course taken back . Now that's one part and that's all where we're on the all tab down , so when this is the active tab. Now I am not done in this flow though, of course can tap a single recipe and that will take us to yet another page where  can view the details about this recipe.

  Not only because that would be very cumbersome to write but also because I want these beautiful animations, these transitions between screens and that's something I thankfully can add in a relatively easy way.
  
   Thank you Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and Academind for this great and valuable content!
